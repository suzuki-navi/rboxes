rselfpack - Self-extracting script generator

DESCRIPTION:
    Creates self-extracting bash scripts from directories or files.
    The generated script contains all source files embedded and can be
    executed on any system with bash to recreate the original file structure.

USAGE:
    rselfpack [options] [PATH]

OPTIONS:
    --help              Display this help message and exit
    --no-compression    Generate script without gzip compression (larger but faster)

ARGUMENTS:
    [PATH]              Path to directory or file to package.
                        If not specified, defaults to current directory.
                        The self-extracting script will be written to stdout.

EXAMPLES:
    rselfpack /path/to/myproject > myproject.sh
        Package entire directory into a self-extracting script

    rselfpack --no-compression . > current-dir.sh
        Package current directory without compression

    rselfpack somefile.txt > somefile.sh
        Package a single file

    chmod +x myproject.sh && ./myproject.sh
        Extract files to current directory

    ./myproject.sh /tmp/extract
        Extract files to specified directory (/tmp/extract)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
    The generated script contains:
    - Argument parsing for optional target directory
    - Base64-encoded file data (compressed by default, unless --no-compression)
    - Directory creation commands
    - File extraction commands for both text and binary files
    - Automatic cleanup of temporary files

FEATURES:
    - Preserves directory structure
    - Handles both text and binary files
    - Automatic binary file detection
    - Optional gzip compression for efficiency
    - Deterministic file ordering
    - Safe heredoc delimiters using content hashes
    - Optional target directory specification

GENERATED SCRIPT USAGE:
    ./script.sh                 Extract to current directory
    ./script.sh /path/to/dir    Extract to specified directory

NOTE:
    The generated self-extracting script accepts an optional target
    directory parameter. If not specified, files are extracted to
    the current working directory.
